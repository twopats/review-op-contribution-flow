# Review: Optimism Monorepo Contributions Process

## Introduction

This is my personal review of the Optimism Monorepo Contributions Process. I am not a member of the Optimism team, and this review is not endorsed by the Optimism team. Just a friendly review from a community member. Follow me to explore the SuperChain together ðŸš€.

## Summary

Overall, I had no hiccups in the main steps. Everything build just fine and I was able to run the tests and build the packages! I also learned a few things to keep in mind along the way! Perhaps you are newer to the ecosystem as well and might find this process helpful shaking the stagefright of contributing to a large project. Here were my main takeaways:

- "No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued" - The ethos is based on being "aggressively opensource" and this is very welcoming to see, especally as a someone newer to public contributions.

- Keep an eye out for the "good first issue" label - This is a great way to get started with a project. I'm hoping to look throught those and take on my next contribution. ^^

- Make sure to do a clean build after switching branches.

- Write appropriate tests when submitting new features!

- Keep in mind https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ when writing commit messages. I'm new to this, so I'm pinning it in my browser!
